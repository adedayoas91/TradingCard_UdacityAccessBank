				<em><i> 
				Beavers are large semi-aquatic rodents<br />
                Over 85% of Eurasian Beavers live in Europe<br />
                They have gnarly gnawing gnashers<br />
                They are super swimmers<br />
                A Beaver's favourite food is aspen and willow<br />
                They can be a bit misunderstood<br />
                The benefits of Beavers can outweigh the costs <br />(<a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/fascinating-facts/beavers">Source</a>  )

				Beavers are the largest rodents in North America and one of the few species that significantly modify their environment. By building watertight dams, which reduce stream erosion and form slow-moving ponds, they provide aquatic habitat for dozens of other species.
